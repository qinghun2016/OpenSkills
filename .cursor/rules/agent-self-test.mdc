# Agent Self-Test
<!-- Agent 主动自测规则 -->

## When self-test is required
<!-- 必须自测的场景 -->

### 1. Web / UI work
- Use `cursor-browser-extension` or `cursor-ide-browser` MCP to open the page, test key flows, and capture screenshots for visual check.

### 2. API work
- Use HTTP requests to test all new or changed endpoints; verify request/response format and error handling.

### 3. Front-end
- Use browser tools to test UI interaction, state updates, and responsive behavior.

### 4. File operations
- Verify files exist, content is correct, and permissions are as expected.

### 5. Config changes
- Verify config is applied and that the change has the intended effect.

## Flow
<!-- 自测流程 -->

1. Finish the development work.
2. Identify what needs testing.
3. Run the relevant MCP/tools and record results.
4. If issues are found, fix them before closing.
