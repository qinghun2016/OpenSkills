# Flat Logo Design Skill

Use this skill when designing or refining logos, icons, favicons, or brand marks. Based on industry practice (e.g. Adobe flat logo design, George Bokhua).

<!-- 何时使用：设计或优化 logo、图标、favicon、品牌标识时。 -->

## Core Principles

- **Silhouette first**: The logo must be recognizable by its outline alone. Start with a strong silhouette; details come second.
- **Flat only**: No gradients, shadows, highlights, or texture. Two-dimensional, simple shapes.
- **1–2 colors**: Limit to one or two bold colors. Test in black and white first; add color last.
- **Strong shapes**: Use basic geometric shapes (circles, rounded rects, simple paths). Memorable symbols are flat and shape-driven.
- **Simple typography**: Pair with sans-serif, minimal letterforms. Keep text short; avoid decorative fonts.

<!-- 轮廓优先、纯扁平、1–2 色、几何造型、简洁字体。 -->

## Process

1. **Research**: Understand the brand, audience, and context.
2. **Sketch in B&W**: Design in black and white first so form and contrast work before color.
3. **Iterate**: Many fast sketches; pick one or two to refine.
4. **Vectorize**: Clean paths, consistent stroke/radius, scalable from favicon to large print.
5. **Add color last**: Apply one or two colors only after the shape works in grayscale.

<!-- 先研究、再黑白草图、迭代、矢量化、最后上色。 -->

## Do Not

- Force letterforms into literal body parts (e.g. P/K as ears) if it weakens the silhouette.
- Mix too many concepts in one mark (e.g. panda + four letters as four body parts).
- Use gradients, drop shadows, or 3D effects.
- Use more than two colors or busy type.

<!-- 避免把字母强行塞进身体部位、避免一个标志里塞太多概念、禁止渐变/阴影/多色/花哨字体。 -->

## For Mascot + Wordmark (e.g. Panda + OPSK)

- Prefer a **clear mascot silhouette** (e.g. panda: round face + two round ears + eyes) plus a **separate wordmark** "OPSK" below or beside it.
- Keep the mascot simple and iconic; keep the wordmark clean and legible.
- Do not distort the mascot to spell letters unless the result is still a strong, readable silhouette.

<!-- 吉祥物与字标分开：吉祥物简洁可辨，字标清晰；不强行用身体拼字母。 -->
